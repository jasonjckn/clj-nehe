h1. Running the Tutorials

You need to have installed Leiningen 1.1.0. Once you've done that you can run the following if you're using Emacs/SLIME or Enclojure:

<pre class="console">
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein swank
</pre>

You can then connect to this REPL.

h1. Tricks

If you pass a display-proxy function to your app you can interact with the tutorials without having to restar the application completely.

h1. Trouble Shooting

The signatures of your methods are *really* important.

(defn reshape [[x y width height] state]
  ...)

It also important that if you use app/start that you pass in a map for the state.

(app/start callback-map {})

If you don't your program will crash immediately.
