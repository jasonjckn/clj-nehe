h1. Running the Tutorials

You need to have installed Leiningen 1.1.0. Once you've done that you can run the following if you're using Emacs/SLIME or Enclojure:

<pre class="console">
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein swank
</pre>

You can then connect to this REPL.

I highly recommend using Emacs/SLIME or Enclojure. It's critical when you're starting out to be able to jump around to source definition. In Emacs this can be done with *M-.*.

h1. Tricks

If you pass a display-proxy function to your app you can interact with the tutorials without having to restar the application completely.

h1. Trouble Shooting

h2. Missing function

Some of the OpenGL has not been brought into Penumbra. However it's simple to import these things yourself with *gl-import*. For example *glClearDepth* has been imported but you can use it in your code like so:

<pre>
(gl-import glClearDepth clear-depth)
</pre>

h2. Signatures

The signatures of your methods are *really* important.

(defn reshape [[x y width height] state]
  ...)

It also important that if you use app/start that you pass in a map for the state.

(app/start callback-map {})

If you don't your program will crash immediately.
